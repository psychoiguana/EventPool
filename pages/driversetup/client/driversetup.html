	EventPool provides a platform where people attending an event  can provide transportation ("Drivers") for other persons wanting to attend that event ("Riders"). Driver has the right to evict Rider from their vehicle if they feel Rider's attitude and/or actions are substantially unsatisfactory or are an immediate threat to Driver's health. However, EventPool is not held accountable if Driver is unsatisfied with Rider's actions and/or attitude. Furthermore, EventPool will not be responsible for damages to Driver's vehicle that may be made during the transportation process; Driver's insurance is accountable for said potential damages.</div></center>
